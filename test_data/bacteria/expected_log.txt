2024-01-12 12:02:47 INFO:	***** Starting Auto Select Lineage *****
	This process runs BUSCO on the generic lineage datasets for the domains archaea, bacteria and eukaryota. Once the optimal domain is selected, BUSCO automatically attempts to find the most appropriate BUSCO dataset to use based on phylogenetic placement.
	--auto-lineage-euk and --auto-lineage-prok are also available if you know your input assembly is, or is not, an eukaryote. See the user guide for more information.
	A reminder: Busco evaluations are valid when an appropriate dataset is used, i.e., the dataset belongs to the lineage of the species to test. Because of overlapping markers/spurious matches among domains, busco matches in another domain do not necessarily mean that your genome/proteome contains sequences from this domain. However, a high busco score in multiple domains might help you identify possible contaminations.
